.Sh NAME
.Nm addr2line
.Nd translate program addresses to source file names and line numbers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -basename
.Op Fl -demangle
.Op Fl -exe Ns = Ns Ar executable
.Op Fl -functions
.Op Fl -help
.Op Fl -target Ns = Ns Ar target
.Op Fl -version
.Op Fl C
.Op Fl H
.Op Fl V
.Op Fl b Ar target
.Op Fl e Ar executable
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl s
.Op Ar hexaddress Ns ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
translates program addresses specified by the command line arguments
.Ar hexaddress
to their corresponding source file names and line numbers.
If no arguments are given to
.Nm ,
it will read these addresses from standard input.
.Pp
Program addresses specified by arguments
.Ar hexaddress
are encoded using the conventions accepted by
.Xr strtoull 3 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility recognizes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl e Ns = Ns Ar executable"
.It Fl -basename
Display only the base name for each file name.
.It Fl -demangle
Demangle C++ names.
.It Fl -exe Ns = Ns Ar executable
Use argument
.Ar executable
to translate addresses.
The default is
.Pa a.out .
.It Fl -functions
Display function names in addition to file and line number information.
.It Fl -help
Print a help message.
.It Fl -target Ns = Ns Ar target
This option is recognized by
.Nm
but is ignored.
It is supported for compatibility with GNU binutils.
.It Fl -version
Print the program version and exit.
.It Fl b
Identical to
.Fl -target .
.It Fl e
Identical to
.Fl -exe .
.It Fl f
Identical to
.Fl -functions .
.It Fl s
Identical to
.Fl -basename .
.It Fl H
Identical to
.Fl -help .
.It Fl V
Identical to
.Fl -version .
.El
.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
If option
.Fl -functions
or
.Fl f
was not specified,
.Nm
will print the file name and line number for each address specified
on a separate line.
.Pp
If option
.Fl -functions
or
.Fl f
was specified,
.Nm
will print a line containing the name of the function corresponding
to program address
.Ar hexaddress ,
followed by a line with the file name and line number.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility prints the file name and line number using the format
.Dq FILENAME:LINENUMBER .
.Pp
If a file or function name could not be determined,
.Nm
will print a question mark in their place.
If the line number could not be determined,
.Nm
will print a zero in its place.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To map address 080483c4 to a source file name and line number use:
.D1 "% addr2line 080483c4"
.Pp
To map address 080483c4 in executable
.Pa helloworld ,
use:
.D1 "% addr2line -e helloworld 080483c4"
.Pp
To have
.Nm
act as a filter reading addresses from its standard input use:
.D1 "% addr2line"
.Pp
To print the function name corresponding to an address, in addition to
its source file and line number use:
.D1 "% addr2line -f 080483c4"
.Sh EXIT STATUS
