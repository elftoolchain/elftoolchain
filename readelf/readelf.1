.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays information about ELF objects.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility recognizes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a | Fl -all
Turn on the following flags:
.Fl d ,
.Fl h ,
.Fl I ,
.Fl l ,
.Fl r ,
.Fl s ,
.Fl A ,
.Fl S
and
.Fl V .
.It Fl c | Fl -archive-index
This option is recognized, but is ignored.
.It Fl d | Fl -dynamic
Print the contents of the
.Li SHT_DYNAMIC
sections in the ELF object.
.It Fl e | Fl -headers
Print all program, file and section headers in the ELF object.
.It Fl g | Fl -section-groups
This option is recognized, but is ignored.
.It Fl h | Fl -file-header
Print the file header of the ELF object.
.It Fl l | Fl -program-headers
Print the content of the program header table for the object.
.It Fl n | Fl -notes
Print the contents of any
.Li SHT_NOTE
sections present in the ELF object.
.It Fl p Ar section-index | Fl -string-dump Ns = Ns Ar section-index
Print the contents of the section at index
.Ar section-index
as printable strings.
.It Fl r | Fl -relocs
Print relocation information.
.It Fl t | Fl -section-details
Print additional information about sections, such as the flags
fields in section headers.
.It Fl v | Fl -version
Prints the version number for
.Nm
and exits.
.It Fl x Ar section-index | Fl -hex-dump Ns = Ns Ar section-index
Display the contents of the section with index
.Ar section-index
as hexadecimal.
.It Fl A | Fl -arch-specific
This option is accepted but is currently unimplemented.
.It Fl D | Fl -use-dynamic
Print the symbol table specified by the
.Li DT_SYMTAB
entry in the
.Li .dynamic
section.
.It Fl H | Fl -help
Print a help message.
.It Fl I | Fl -histogram
Print information on bucket list lengths for sections of type
.Li SHT_HASH
and
.Li SHT_GNU_HASH .
.It Fl N | Fl -full-section-name
This option is accepted but is currently unimplemented.
.It Fl S | Fl -sections | Fl -section-headers
Print information in the section headers for each ELF object.
.It Fl V | Fl -version-info
Print symbol versioning information.
.It Fl W | Fl -wide
Print information about ELF structures using one long line per
structure.
If this option is not specified,
.Nm
will list information in the headers of 64 bit ELF objects on two
separate lines.
