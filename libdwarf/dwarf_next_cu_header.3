.Nd step through compilation units in a DWARF debug context
.Sh LIBRARY

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdwarf.h
.Ft int
.Fo dwarf_next_cu_header
.Fa "Dwarf_Debug dbg"
.Fa "Dwarf_Unsigned *cu_header_length"
.Fa "Dwarf_Half *cu_version"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_next_cu_header
steps to the next compilation unit context associated with the DWARF
debug context and optionally returns information about the unit.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar dbg
should reference a DWARF debug context allocated using
.Xr dwarf_init 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar cu_header_length
should point to a location that will be set to the
length of the compilation unit header.
Argument
.Ar cu_version
should point to a location that will be set to the
version number for the compilation unit.
Argument
.Ar cu_abbrev_offset
should point to a location that will be set to the
starting offset in the
.Dq .debug_abbrev
section of the set of debugging information entry abbreviations
associated with this compilation unit.
Argument
.Ar cu_pointer_size
should point to a location that will be set to the
size of an address in bytes for the machine architecture of the
underlying debugging object.
Argument
.Ar cu_next_offset
should point to a location that will be set to the
offset of the next compilation unit.
Argument
.Ar err
should point to a location that will hold an error descriptor in case
of an error.
.Pp
A value of NULL may be used for any of the arguments
.Ar cu_header_length ,
.Ar cu_version ,
.Ar cu_abbrev_offset ,
.Ar cu_pointer_size ,
.Ar cu_next_offset
and
.Ar err
indicating that the caller is not interested in the
respective value.
.Ss Iterating Through Compilation Units in a Debug Context
.Pp
The first call to function
.Fn dwarf_next_cu_header
for a given debug context will return information about the first
compilation unit in the debug context.
Subsequent calls to this function will step through the compilation
units in the debug context.
On stepping past the last compilation unit in the debug context,
.Fn dwarf_next_cu_header
resets its internal state so that a subsequent call to the function
will start again from the first compilation unit in the debug context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, function
.Fn dwarf_next_cu_header
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK .
In case of an error, it returns
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and sets argument
.Ar err .
If the is no more compilation unit, it returns
.Dv DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_next_cu_header
can fail with the following error:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Va dbg
was NULL.
