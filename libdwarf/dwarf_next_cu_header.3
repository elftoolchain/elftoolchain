.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_next_cu_header
sets the internal compilation unit context assoicaited with
.Vt Dwarf_Debug
descriptor
.Ar dbg
to the next compilation unit.
.Pp
On success,
.No \&* Ns Va cu_header_length
is set to the length of the CU header,
.No \&* Ns Va cu_version
is set to the CU version,
.No \&* Ns Va cu_abbrev_offset
is set to the offset in the .debug_abbrev section
of the set of debugging
information entry abbreviations associated with
this CU.
.No \&* Ns Va cu_pointer_size
is set to the size of an address in bytes for
the target architecture.
.No \&* Ns Va cu_next_offset
is set to the offset of the next compilation unit
in the .debug_info section.
.Pp
If there is no more compilation unit in the
.Vt Dwarf_Debug
descriptor
.Ar dbg ,
function
.Fn dwarf_next_cu_header
sets the internal CU context to NULL and returns
.Dv DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY .
The subsequent call to this function will rewind
the internal CU context to the first compilation unit.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, function
.Fn dwarf_next_cu_header
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK .
In case of an error, it returns
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and sets argument
.Ar err .
If there is no more compilation unit, it returns
.Dv DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_next_cu_header
can fail with the following error:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Va dbg
was NULL.
